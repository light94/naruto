naruto
======
This script can be used for downloading naruto shippuden episodes from narutospot.net .
To use this script, download it in a folder where you would like to save your naruto episodes. Next, create a text file called naruto.txt and type in the last naruto shippuden episode that you saw. Then just go to terminal and do python naruto.py. The terminal will inform you if the next video has been released or not. If it is released, it will download the video for you. Also, naruto episodes are usually released on thursdays(4-6pm IST), so the script runs only on thursdays(:P you can easily change that).
